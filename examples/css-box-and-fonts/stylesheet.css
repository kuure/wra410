/*

google fonts - you can load multiple fonts in a single line to save time

this _must_ be the first line in your CSS

to get the code you need to choose the "get embed code" button, then select
the @import button

remove the <style> and </style> tags - those are HTML and don't belong in a CSS file
*/





/*

Style Requirements:

- a thin visible border
- a different background color than the <body> and each other
- rounded corners
- enough white space between the text and border to be easily readable. 
- the <h1> and <p> tags need to be in different Google Fonts
