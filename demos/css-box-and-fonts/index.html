			<h1>This is a Box</h1>

			that's about it</p>
		</div>


		<div class="box box02">
			<h1>This is another Box</h1>

			<p>Let that brush dance around there and play. We'll put all the little
			clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Let all these things
			just sort of happen. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right
			there. You are only limited by your imagination. See how easy it is to
			create a little tree right in your world.</p>

			<p>We can fix anything. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Let's
			do it again then, what the heck. This is probably the greatest thing to
			happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. If you hypnotize
			it, it will go away. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees
			and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.</p>

			<p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Those great
			big fluffy clouds. You're meant to have fun in life. This is unplanned it
			really just happens. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are
			not wasted. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you
			practice you can do.</p>

			<p>Even the worst thing we can do here is good. We don't make mistakes we
			just have happy little accidents. Use what happens naturally, don't fight
			it.</p>
